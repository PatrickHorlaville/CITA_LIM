# PHYS512: Final Project

This is the repository for my final project for the class PHYS512: Computational Physics with Applications, delivered in the Fall 2022 by prof. Jon Sievers at McGill, with TAs Rigel Zifkin, Marcus Merryfield and Daniel Coelho.

The entirety of the project is presented in `project_notebook.ipynb`. The scripts it uses are drawing from an external package called `limlam_mocker` that are present in this repository along other utility files that populate the directory. The result files are in the `result_files folder.
