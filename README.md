# Line Intensity Mapping at CITA

This is the repository for my working space at CITA on line intensity mapping. My project is using the `limlam_mocker` package (written by Dr. George Stein and Dr. Dongwoo Chung in 2018), more precisely a modified version by Dr. Patrick Breysse and his supervisee Clara Chung written in 2020 for Clara Chung's SURP project.
